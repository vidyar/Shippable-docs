Signing in
===============


We use GitHub authentication to get started with our CI, So clicking on the Log In button will take you to the GitHub Signin page.GitHub will ask you to grant read and write access. Shippable needs read/write access to identify you by your github login when you request it for the first time, but it won't touch anything else. You will be redirected to our site after signing in through Github.

If you are already signed in to GitHub, you will automatically be redirected to our site.

Pick the public or private github project that you would like to build from the welcome page.
